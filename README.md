# 👋 **Hello, Welcome to My Page!**

## 🚀 **About Me**

🎓 I’m **Monyea Logan**, a passionate software developer currently enrolled at **Western Governors University (WGU)**, where I’m pursuing a **Bachelor’s in Software Engineering**. I’m set to graduate by the end of **November 2024**, and along the way, I’ve earned certifications in both **Front-End** and **Back-End Development**. My journey into software development started unexpectedly when I stumbled across it, and soon I fell in love with the process of creating something from scratch. The thrill of turning ideas into functional applications drives me every day.

👨‍💻 With a deep interest in **open-source projects** and **app development**, I’ve built up solid experience working on various applications, both front-end and back-end. I enjoy collaborating with others, constantly learning, and pushing boundaries to develop innovative solutions. Currently, I’m diving deeper into **Java**, **C#**, and exploring more **React** and **Node.js** to enhance my skills.

🎸 Outside the world of tech, I find joy in nature and adventure! Whether it’s **glamping**, **kayaking**, or even **cliff jumping**, I love being in the great outdoors. I also push myself to learn new skills, from picking up the guitar to experimenting with creative hobbies.

📚 **Books & Learning:** I’m passionate about reading, and two of my favorite books are *A Million Kisses in Your Lifetime* and *Pride and Prejudice*—stories that inspire both creativity and romance.

✈️ **Travel Enthusiast:** I’ve traveled to some amazing places, but **Istanbul** and **Toronto** are by far my favorite destinations. Exploring new cultures and cities fuels my creativity and love for adventure.
